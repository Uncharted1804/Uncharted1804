# About Me

Hey, I'm Shaurya Mittal Nair — a technologist, researcher, and systems builder with a passion for creating **AI-powered solutions that scale**.

 I specialize in **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**, with deep experience in:
- **Drone architecture & control systems**
-  **ML-infused security systems** (biometric fusion, anomaly detection, etc.)
-  **Dataset structuring, processing & optimization**
-  **Research on diffusion models** — including optimization and efficiency improvements

I'm not just an engineer — I'm a problem-solver who loves pushing boundaries and experimenting at the edge of what's possible with AI.
